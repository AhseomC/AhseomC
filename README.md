👋 Hi guys! My name is Ahseom. 

👾 I'm an artist trying to learn how to code. 

🤖 I’ve always been fascinated by cutting-edge technologies. Such techs like AI, machine learning, blockchain technology, and algorithms that run them felt like magic to me. And I have looked up to professional software engineers who created them. Their work is often invisible, but it has a huge impact on our lives.

⚙️ I’m also very interested in creating things that can help people live better lives. I believe technology is the key to solving many of the world's problems and I want to contribute my part.
To do that, first, I had to learn how to use technology. That’s why I started to learn how to code. 

🤯 I’m currently learning HTML/CSS/Javascript by taking online courses from FreeCodeCamp and the Odin Project. I will upload every step I take on GitHub. 

📍 My first goal is to finish the HTML/CSS/Javascript Course from both platforms. and then I will start working on my project. 

🧗‍♀️ It’s gonna be such a journey. I’m looking forward to sharing it with you.
